# Weather Forecast Function

## Overview
The `WeatherForecast` function (implemented in the `HttpTrigger` class) provides a simple demonstration API endpoint that generates mock weather forecast data. This serves as a template and testing endpoint for the Azure Functions infrastructure.

## Purpose
- Provide a simple GET endpoint for testing API connectivity
- Demonstrate basic Azure Functions HTTP trigger implementation
- Generate sample data for development and testing purposes
- Serve as a reference implementation for other API functions

## Endpoint

### GET /api/WeatherForecast
**Function Name:** `WeatherForecast`
- **Authorization:** Anonymous
- **HTTP Methods:** GET only
- **Purpose:** Generate and return mock weather forecast data
- **Returns:** JSON array of weather forecast objects with temperature and summary data

## General Workflow

### Request Processing
1. Receive HTTP GET request
2. Initialize random number generator
3. Generate 5 weather forecast entries
4. Each entry includes:
   - Date (tomorrow's date for all entries)
   - Random temperature between -20°C and 55°C
   - Weather summary based on temperature
5. Serialize data to JSON format
6. Return HTTP 200 response with forecast data

## Data Generation Logic

### Temperature Generation
- Uses `Random.Next(-20, 55)` to generate temperatures
- Range covers typical weather conditions from freezing to hot
- Each forecast uses the same temperature (potential bug - should be different for each day)

### Weather Summary Logic
Temperature-based summary assignment:
- **32°C and above:** "Hot"
- **17°C to 31°C:** "Mild"
- **1°C to 16°C:** "Cold"
- **0°C and below:** "Freezing"

## Response Format
```json
[
  {
    "Date": "2024-01-02T10:30:00.000Z",
    "TemperatureC": 25,
    "Summary": "Mild"
  }
  // ... 4 more entries
]
```

## Technical Implementation

### Class Structure
- **Class Name:** `HttpTrigger` (generic name, could be more specific)
- **Dependency Injection:** Uses `ILoggerFactory` for logging capability
- **Static Methods:** `GetSummary()` helper method for temperature-to-summary mapping

### Logging
- Logger is initialized but not actively used in the current implementation
- Available for debugging and monitoring if needed

## Usage Scenarios
1. **API Health Check:** Verify Azure Functions are running and responding
2. **Development Testing:** Test HTTP client configurations and JSON deserialization
3. **Infrastructure Validation:** Confirm API gateway and routing are working
4. **Template Reference:** Example of basic Azure Functions HTTP trigger structure

## Potential Improvements
1. **Fix Date Generation:** Each forecast entry should have different dates
2. **Improve Temperature Variation:** Generate different temperatures for each day
3. **Add Logging:** Implement request/response logging for monitoring
4. **Error Handling:** Add try-catch blocks for robustness
5. **Class Naming:** Rename `HttpTrigger` to `WeatherForecastFunction` for clarity
6. **Add More Data:** Include humidity, wind speed, or other weather parameters

## Dependencies
- **Microsoft.Azure.Functions.Worker:** Core Azure Functions runtime
- **System.Net:** HTTP status codes and response handling
- **BlazorApp.Shared:** Shared models (though not currently used in this function)
