# Testing Guide for Recent Fixes

## What Was Fixed

### ? 1. Image Preloading and Caching
- Added `<link rel="preload">` tags in index.html for all game images
- Added JavaScript function to preload images on page load
- This should significantly improve loading performance

### ? 2. Breakdown Layout Improvement
- Changed from full-width items to a 2x3 grid layout
- Items are now centered and more compact
- Responsive design: 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile

### ? 3. Network Error Fix
- Enhanced error handling with specific messages for API connection issues
- Created appsettings.json for proper API endpoint configuration
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Fixed "Points/Click" display in save modal

## How to Test

### Step 1: Start the API Server
```bash
cd Api
func start
```
**Important**: The API must be running on http://localhost:7071 for score saving to work.

### Step 2: Start the Client
```bash
cd Client
dotnet run
```

### Step 3: Test Image Loading
1. Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab and refresh the page
3. Look for preloaded images - they should load faster on subsequent games

### Step 4: Test Breakdown Layout
1. Play a game to completion
2. Click "View Details" in the results
3. Expand "Breakdown by Type" section
4. Verify items are arranged in a nice 2x3 grid (not full width)

### Step 5: Test Score Saving
1. Complete a game
2. Click "Save Score" 
3. Enter a name and click "Save Score"

**If you see an error**: Check the browser console (F12) for detailed error messages. The enhanced error handling will tell you exactly what's wrong.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### "NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource"
**Solution**: Make sure the API is running:
1. Open terminal in `Api` directory
2. Run `func start`
3. Ensure you see "Functions: [GET,POST] http://localhost:7071/api/leaderboard"

### Images still loading slowly
**Solution**: 
1. Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
2. Check Network tab to see if preload links are working
3. Images should be cached after first load

### Breakdown layout not showing as 2x3
**Solution**:
1. Make sure the CSS file was updated
2. Try a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check responsive design at different screen sizes

## Performance Improvements

The image preloading should provide:
- ? Faster initial page load
- ? Instant image display during gameplay
- ? Better user experience with no loading delays
- ? Cached images for subsequent games

## Next Steps

If you're still experiencing issues:
1. Check browser console for any error messages
2. Verify both API and Client are running
3. Try different browsers to rule out caching issues
4. Check that all files were saved correctly

The game should now be much more responsive and the leaderboard functionality should work properly!
